<h1>Web Site Critiques</h1>
<hr />
<a href="https://www.traderjoes.com/home"><h2>Trader Joe's</h2></a>
<ol><h3>1. What was your first impression of this site?</h3></ol>
The Trader Joe's web site is filled with a lot of information. My initial impression is that they keep everything accessible. It seems a bit outdated, but they have a lot of hyperlinks to other parts of the site. Something that I liked was that there is a section on the main page that shows tasty recipes. 
<hr />
<ol><h3>2. How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links
on the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?)</h3></ol>
The organization flow is all centered, and there is a dropdown menu that shows links on the righthand side. 
<hr />
<ol><h3>3. Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?</h3></ol>
Personally I think that the web site could be less intimidating for users. I prefer having the flow of information coming from subheadings on the top part of the page, where it is quicker to see the all the options.
<hr />
<ol><h3>4. Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from
it? Why?</h3></ol>
The layout as a whole detracts from the site because it is hard to navigate. The pictures are nice and the resources are helpful, but overall it is overwhelming and easy to get lost.
<hr />
<ol><h3>5. How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time
reasonable?</h3></ol>
The load time was quick. I didn't see any issues with the home page loading slow or not registering all the features.
<hr />
<ol><h3>6. Was the text color and size readable? If a background color or
image was used, did it enhance or detract from the site?</h3></ol>
The text color and size was readable and the background was fine. Right on the landing page there is a large background picture that displays a meal made with Trader Joe's ingredients. It is distracting but not hard to read since there is a text box over it.
<hr />
<ol><h3>7. Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was the
navigation well done?</h3></ol>
I don't love the layout of the navigation on the web site. The hamburger menu icon for navigation, when clicked, opens the navigation that covers the whole screen. When each heading is clicked, a list of subheadings is displayed that are all hyperlinks.
<hr />
<ol><h3>8. Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all
the pages?</h3></ol>
The color scheme of the site is tailored to fall, since Trader Joe's is trying to push the current season and all their seasonal products.
<hr />
<ol><h3>9. How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)?</h3></ol>
The site responds fine to small window sizes. Sometimes when sites are minimized, it can distort the images and links. However, the Trader Joes heading stays the same size and everything stays orderly.
<hr />
<ol><h3>10. What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?</h3></ol>
Something that the Trader Joe's site offers that is surprisingly unexpected is that they show recipe ideas and also stories that coincide with the fall theme. These links on the homepage are unexpected for a grocery store website. The art for the links are pretty and it makes the website pop.
